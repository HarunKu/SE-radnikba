# SE-radnikba

Radnikba is an online platform for advertising construction workers. Aware of the lack of construction workers in our country, we believe that a platform is needed so that insight into all workers is more easily accessible. Users of the platform will be able to see all the basic information about workers.

The project was done as part of the **IT 309 Software Engineering** course at International Burch University.
